The importance of editorial focus and content reasoning: the ability to identify the most important and relevant stories in the data, and the principles responsible for optimizing the interpretation experience for the target audience.
To understand the importance of graphical literacy in performing visual analysis tasks. Rationalizing the data represents the options involved in the solution. Data variables and the type of chart that can hold them will provide you with a tracking solution. Need to choose the appropriate data to represent the solution's challenges, and then separate the different aspects of the data representation to create a unified design concept. It provides us with effective strategies and strategies that allow us to move gracefully in this potentially complex design process.
Even the owner of this subject must try to avoid making mistakes and end up in a creative blind. A valuable design is rarely implemented immediately and does not require iteration and rethinking.
A key piece of information is to make things right, straightforward, and every time. Hopefully, following this decision and option framework will give us the best possible opportunity to find solutions faster and more efficiently through practice and experience. Carefully study the classification of different visualization methods and the various common chart type techniques that fall into each category. This will help to consolidate the understanding of the data presentation layer, which is undoubtedly the most important design feature and provides a convenient library of options for the project.
